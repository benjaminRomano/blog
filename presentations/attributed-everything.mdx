In this Droidcon SF session, engineers from Snapchat's module infrastructure team will talk about various strategies
that Snapchat uses to ensure quality for its new Android application, which has hundreds of active contributors across
dozens of individual teams. The talk will show how proper attribution of application resources (from CPU and app size to
